- [ ] Metrics collection operational
- [ ] Alert rules active and appropriate
- [ ] Dashboard updated with new deployment
- [ ] Tracing and profiling enabled

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Trading volume within expected range
- [ ] Success rates meeting targets
- [ ] Profit/loss calculations accurate
- [ ] User activity patterns normal
- [ ] API response times acceptable

### Infrastructure Metrics
- [ ] CPU utilization below 80%
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] Network I/O within expected ranges
- [ ] Database connection pool healthy
- [ ] Cache hit rates acceptable

## Rollback Preparedness

### Automatic Triggers
- [ ] Error rate threshold: 5% for 5 minutes
- [ ] Response time threshold: 2x baseline for 3 minutes
- [ ] Health check failure: 3 consecutive failures
- [ ] Database connection errors: >10 per minute

### Manual Rollback Criteria
- [ ] Critical functionality broken
- [ ] Data corruption detected
- [ ] Security vulnerability identified
- [ ] Performance degradation unacceptable
- [ ] User impact significant

### Rollback Procedures
- [ ] Rollback script tested and ready
- [ ] Database rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Communication plan for stakeholders
- [ ] Post-rollback verification checklist

## Post-Deployment Activities

### Immediate (First Hour)
- [ ] Monitor key business transactions
- [ ] Verify all external integrations
- [ ] Check security event logs
- [ ] Validate backup procedures
- [ ] Confirm monitoring alerts functional

### Short-term (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Performance trend analysis
- [ ] Error pattern review
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Cost impact assessment
- [ ] Capacity planning review

### Long-term (First Week)
- [ ] Deployment success metrics review
- [ ] Incident response effectiveness
- [ ] User adoption and satisfaction
- [ ] Business impact assessment
- [ ] Lessons learned documentation

## Emergency Procedures

### Service Degradation
1. **Identify**: Monitor dashboards for anomalies
2. **Contain**: Implement rate limiting if needed
3. **Analyze**: Check logs and metrics for root cause
4. **Communicate**: Notify stakeholders of issue and ETA
5. **Resolve**: Apply fix or initiate rollback

### Security Incident
1. **Detect**: Security monitoring alerts
2. **Isolate**: Block suspicious traffic/access
3. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
4. **Remediate**: Apply security patches
5. **Recover**: Restore services with enhanced security

### Data Issues
1. **Identify**: Data inconsistency reports
2. **Quarantine**: Isolate affected data
3. **Restore**: From backup if necessary
4. **Validate**: Data integrity checks
5. **Prevent**: Update procedures to prevent recurrence

## Continuous Improvement

### Deployment Metrics Tracking
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Change failure rate
- Deployment success rate

### Checklist Optimization
- Review checklist effectiveness quarterly
- Update based on incident learnings
- Simplify where automation exists
- Add new verification steps as needed
- Remove obsolete verification steps

### Automation Opportunities
- Automated security scanning
- Infrastructure as code validation
- Performance regression testing
- Canary analysis automation
- Rollback automation triggers
